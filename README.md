# The World Transformed

**Britain's and then the world's promise fulfilled.**

## Thesis
The bottleneck isn't ideas or capital—it's coordination. LLMs are navigation tools through possibility space, not prediction engines. We can now find true descriptions that enable action at scale.

## The Flywheel
**New Britain** (ideation) → **Clamour** (structured debate) → **Claimer** (enforcement)

Each feeds the next. Ideas surface, get stress-tested publicly, become enforceable commitments.

## Why Now
- Frontier models crossed the agentic threshold (Dec 2024)
- Political window post-election
- Existing institutions failing visibly

## The Ask
[What you need from the five]

## The Offer
[What they get / why this serves their interests]

## Evidence
[Links to your existing work, ITIF credentials, STAG, prior wins]

## Vision
So people can raise kids in peace.
