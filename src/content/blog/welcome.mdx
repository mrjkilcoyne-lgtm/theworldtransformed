## Welcome

This is where I explore ideas at the intersection of economics, technology policy, and coordination mechanisms.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Economics**: Market-oriented policy analysis grounded in institutional economics
- **Technology Policy**: Critical analysis of AI governance and digital regulation
- **Philosophy**: Questions about coordination, collective action, and possibility space
- **Tools**: Practical mechanisms for navigation and decision-making

## The Approach

Three principles guide this work:

1. **Navigation beats prediction** - We can't forecast complex systems, but we can explore possibility space
2. **Follow the money** - Track distributional effects and rent-seeking to understand policy
3. **Build coordination infrastructure** - Enable collective action without capture

## What's Next

I'm currently developing The Brunel Engine, a tool for turning frustrations into actionable insights through structured interviews. More on that soon.
