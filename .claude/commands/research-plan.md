# Research & Planning Mode

Enter deep research mode for the topic provided. Use extended thinking and thorough analysis.

## Process

1. **Understand the Question**
   - What exactly am I being asked to research?
   - What are the key unknowns?
   - What would a good answer look like?

2. **Search Strategy**
   - What sources are most relevant?
   - What search terms will find the best information?
   - What perspectives am I missing?

3. **Information Gathering**
   - Academic sources
   - Policy documents
   - Industry analysis
   - Contrarian viewpoints
   - Primary sources where possible

4. **Synthesis**
   - What are the key findings?
   - What patterns emerge?
   - What contradictions exist?
   - What's missing from the discourse?

5. **Critical Analysis**
   - Follow the money: Who benefits?
   - What are the incentives?
   - What are the second-order effects?
   - What would happen if the opposite were true?

6. **Structured Output**
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings
   - Evidence and sources
   - Contrarian views
   - Gaps in knowledge
   - Recommendations for further research

## Tone

- Use "think hard" or "think harder" for complex topics
- Take time to explore thoroughly
- Prioritize accuracy over speed
- Question assumptions
- Follow evidence, not narratives

**Action**: Research the provided topic using this framework and deliver a comprehensive analysis.
