# Policy Analysis Framework

Analyze the provided policy document or proposal using this structured framework:

## 1. Executive Summary
- What is this policy?
- Who proposed it?
- What problem does it claim to solve?

## 2. Follow the Money
**Distributional Analysis:**
- Who benefits from this policy?
- Who bears the costs?
- What are the rent-seeking opportunities?
- Who captures value vs. who creates value?

## 3. Institutional Analysis
**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- What coordination problem does this address?
- What new coordination problems does it create?
- How does it affect collective action?
- What are the second-order effects?

## 4. Implementation Reality
**Practical Considerations:**
- Who enforces this?
- What are the compliance costs?
- What are the incentives for regulators?
- What are the unintended consequences?

## 5. Alternatives Analysis
**What Else Could Work:**
- Market-based alternatives
- Voluntary coordination mechanisms
- Infrastructure changes that eliminate the problem
- Navigation vs. prediction approaches

## 6. Philosophical Foundations
**Underlying Assumptions:**
- What view of human nature does this assume?
- What role for the state?
- Individual liberty vs. collective action tradeoffs
- Long-term vs. short-term thinking

## 7. The Real Question
**Strip away the rhetoric:**
- What is this *actually* doing?
- Who is this *actually* for?
- What would Matt Kilcoyne say about this?

## 8. Recommendation
- Support / Oppose / Modify
- Key concerns
- Suggested improvements
- Strategic positioning

**Tone**: Objective, analytical, follow the money. No unnecessary validation. Focus on facts and mechanisms, not intentions.
